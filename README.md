# C Programming - Search and Sort Application

This repository contains a C-based application designed to handle text input from a file, perform search and sort operations, and display the sorted results. The program takes advantage of command-line arguments, input processing, and sorting algorithms provided by the C standard library. Developed as part of COMP 348.

## Language: C

## Type: Individual Assignment

## Course Objective

The objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience in working with C language, particularly focusing on file I/O, string manipulation, sorting, and command-line arguments.

## Main Takeaway

- Developing a command-line interface for file input and processing.
- Utilizing C functions for file handling, reading, and writing data.
- Implementing sorting and search algorithms using standard C library functions.
- Gaining experience in handling command-line arguments and parsing input.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Search and Sort Text File Program

- **Objective:**  
  To build a simple text search and sort application using C, that can read a file, search for specific words, and display the results in sorted order.

- **Description:**  
  The program reads a text file, processes the content into an array of strings, allows searching for specific words, and sorts the content based on user-defined criteria (ascending or descending order). It also supports word type filtering (e.g., alphabetic, alphanumeric).

- **Key Features:**
  - Command-line argument parsing for input file, sort order, word type, and skip words.
  - File handling to read and write word data.
  - Skips non-word characters and performs sorting.
  - Displays sorted data in a formatted manner, ensuring proper handling of newlines.
  - Error handling for missing parameters or invalid inputs.

## IDE

- **VSCode** (1.85.2)
